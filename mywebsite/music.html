			My Love for Music
		</h1>
		<p>
			Here, I hope to share with you some of my favorite music tracks. You may have seen the "play", "pause" and "next" buttons in the upper right corner. This'll play you my current (I'll try to keep it as up to date as possible!) favorite song. Many of the songs that I like can be from very different genres and I hope that we can both share a somewhat unpredictable journey :)
