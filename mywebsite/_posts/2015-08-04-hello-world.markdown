I guess this is the first post of my blog. To be honest, I don't really know where to start. Maybe it would be best if I started with an outline or something to help lay down some goals/ideas that I'd like to keep in mind while I do my best to maintain this blog.

Purpose and Goals
-----------------
1. Learn to write clearer and more concisely
2. Practice explaining my thoughts and perspective on miscellaneous topics (e.g. current events, articles, technology, etc.)
3. Share some of my favorite things (e.g. music, books, movies, etc.).
    * As well as write some reviews (both critical and praising).
4. Document my daily life in little snippets 
5. Detail my attempts to navigate a life of self directed learning
    * At certain points in my life I want to explore the following more deeply:
        1. Mathematics
        2. Physics
        3. Natural Sciences like Biology and Organic Chemistry
        4. Art/Art History
        5. History
        6. Music - both performing/playing and critical listening
        7. Astronomy
    * Once I've learned a little, I would also like to take time to teach what I've learned
6. Eventually open my thoughts/posts to discussion/comments from readers
7. Account for more adventureous escapades like traveling, etc.
8. Share some of my own creative fiction

I think that is a pretty good list so far. Ambitious, but I hope not overly so. I really hope that all of these goals are at least vaguely achievable! I really doubt anyone will ever take the time to read these first few posts (if any of my posts at all). But I hope that one day, somewhere, that my voice will be heard, if only for a short while :)
