	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>My name is John Louie, and you have just found my personal website! Welcome! This website is meant to be a combination of many things. While its most basic purpose is to serve as a portal to important information about me, I hope that this website helps one to not only see and learn what I am capable of, but also gain a better understanding of <strong><em>who I am</em></strong>.</p>
	<p><em>Education</em></p>
	<p>I'll keep this portion short: I am currently a junior studying Computer Science at <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>. You can see my résumé <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>. I am fascinated by the intersection between medicine/healthcare and technology and strongly believe that it is one of the few great frontiers that technology has yet to truly revolutionize. Owing to my interest in medicine and healthcare, I have taken numerous classes in Human Biology in addiiton to my computer science classes. I am also very interested in education--teaching, tutoring, helping, how to improve it, etc.--and I am an active <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">section leader</a> for Stanford Univeristy's introductory computer sciences courses (<a href="http://cs106a.stanford.edu">CS106A</a>/<a href="http://cs106b.stanford.edu">CS106B</a>/<a href="http://cs106x.stanford.edu">CS106X</a>).</p>
	<p><em>Interests</em></p>
	<p>I like to think that I'm fascinated by a lot of things. Rather than ramble on in paragraph form, I'll simply make a list below:</p>
