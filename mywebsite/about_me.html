	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>My name is John Louie, and you have just found my personal website! Welcome! This website is meant to be a combination of many things. While its most basic purpose is to serve as a portal to what I consider to be important information about myself, I hope that this website helps one not only see and learn what I am capable of, but also gain a better understanding of who I am.</p>
	<h3>Experience:</h3>
	<p>I'll keep this next portion short: I am currently a junior studying Computer Science at <a href="https://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>. You can see my résumé <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>. I am fascinated by the intersection between medicine/healthcare and technology and strongly believe that it is one of the few great frontiers that technology has yet to truly revolutionize. Owing to my interest in medicine and healthcare, I have taken numerous classes in <a href="https://humanbiology.stanford.edu/">Human Biology</a> in addition to my computer science classes. I am also very interested in education and am an active <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">section leader</a> for Stanford Univeristy's introductory computer sciences courses: <a href="http://cs106a.stanford.edu">CS106A</a>, <a href="http://cs106b.stanford.edu">CS106B</a> and <a href="http://cs106x.stanford.edu">CS106X</a>.</p>
	<p>In addition to school, during the summer of 2014, I conducted bioinformatics research in the <a href="http://ashleylab.stanford.edu/">Ashley Lab</a> at the Stanford University School of Medicine, and during the summer of 2015, I was a software engineering intern for the start up <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>I hope you enjoy exploring the rest of my website!</h2>
